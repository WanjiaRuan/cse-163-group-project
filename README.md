This project mainly focus on the analysis of the Happiness scores based on the social indexes. This analysis is based on the “World Happiness Report“ Dataset and we focus our analysis between the years 2018 to 2021. Moreover, we also combined "world" (GeoDataFrame) with Happiness Dataset for further analysis and evaluation.
